# Skills Index

General-purpose, always-on skills using the open [skills standard](https://skills.sh/).

These skills are intended to be broadly useful across projects and safe to keep
installed globally as part of an agent's default toolbox.

## agent-self-learning

**Agent Self-Learning (Flight Recorder)**

Silently logs friction points (detours, retries, missing tools, assumptions, user questions, quality issues) to `.agent/learning-log.md` so you can improve workflows over time. The agent only mentions the log at task completion if any entries were created.

**Installation:**
```bash
npx skills add <owner>/ak-skills-core --skill agent-self-learning
```
